### Calculation Models

#### Model 1: Productivity-Based ROI

**Baseline Annual Team Cost:**
```
Total Annual Team Cost = Number of Developers × Average Annual Developer Cost
Example: 20 developers × $200,000 = $4,000,000
```

**Productivity Improvement Projections:**
```
Conservative Estimate: 25% productivity improvement
Moderate Estimate: 40% productivity improvement
Aggressive Estimate: 60% productivity improvement
```

**Annual Productivity Value:**
```
Productivity Value = Total Annual Team Cost × Productivity Improvement %
Conservative: $4,000,000 × 25% = $1,000,000
Moderate: $4,000,000 × 40% = $1,600,000
Aggressive: $4,000,000 × 60% = $2,400,000
```

**Net ROI Calculation:**
```
Net ROI = (Annual Productivity Value - Program Investment) / Program Investment × 100
Conservative ROI = ($1,000,000 - $85,000) / $85,000 × 100 = 1,076%
Moderate ROI = ($1,600,000 - $85,000) / $85,000 × 100 = 1,782%
Aggressive ROI = ($2,400,000 - $85,000) / $85,000 × 100 = 2,724%
```

#### Model 2: Time-to-Market ROI

**Revenue Impact Calculation:**
```
Average Monthly Revenue per Feature: $[___,___]
Current Feature Delivery Time: [___] months
Improved Feature Delivery Time: [___] months (typically 30-50% reduction)
Time Savings per Feature: [___] months
Features Delivered Annually: [___]
```

**Annual Time-to-Market Value:**
```
Monthly Revenue Acceleration = Average Monthly Revenue per Feature × Time Savings × Features per Year
Example: $50,000 × 2 months × 12 features = $1,200,000 annual value
```

#### Model 3: Quality Improvement ROI

**Bug Resolution Cost Savings:**
```
Current Bugs per Month: [___]
Average Bug Resolution Cost: $[___] (developer time + impact)
Expected Bug Reduction: [___]% (typically 40-70%)
Annual Bug Cost Savings = Current Bugs × 12 × Bug Resolution Cost × Reduction %
Example: 50 bugs × 12 × $2,000 × 60% = $720,000
```

**Security Vulnerability Reduction:**
```
Current Critical Vulnerabilities per Year: [___]
Average Vulnerability Remediation Cost: $[___,___]
Expected Vulnerability Reduction: [___]% (typically 50-80%)
Annual Security Savings = Vulnerabilities × Remediation Cost × Reduction %
Example: 12 vulnerabilities × $25,000 × 70% = $210,000
```

## ROI Calculator Templates

### Template 1: Quick ROI Assessment

```
Team Size: [___] developers
Annual Team Cost: $[___,___,___]
Program Investment: $[___,___]
Expected Productivity Improvement: [___]%

Quick ROI Calculation:
Annual Value = Team Cost × Productivity %
ROI = (Annual Value - Investment) / Investment × 100

Example:
Team Size: 15 developers
Annual Team Cost: $3,000,000
Program Investment: $85,000
Expected Improvement: 35%

Annual Value = $3,000,000 × 35% = $1,050,000
Net Value = $1,050,000 - $85,000 = $965,000
ROI = $965,000 / $85,000 × 100 = 1,135%
```

## Value Driver Deep Dive

### Developer Productivity Value Calculation

**Time Savings Breakdown:**
```
Current State (per developer per week):
- Actual coding time: 11.2 hours (28% of 40 hours)
- Administrative/context switching: 28.8 hours

With Agentic Engineering:
- Increased coding efficiency: 40% faster
- Reduced administrative overhead: 30% reduction
- Net additional productive time: 6-10 hours per week per developer
```

**Productivity Value Formula:**
```
Weekly Value per Developer = (Additional Productive Hours × Hourly Rate) + 
                            (Efficiency Improvement × Coding Hours × Hourly Rate)
Example: (8 hours × $100) + (40% × 16 hours × $100) = $800 + $640 = $1,440/week
Annual Value per Developer = $1,440 × 50 weeks = $72,000
```

### Quality Improvement Value

**Reduced Bug Costs:**
```
Current State:
- Bugs per developer per month: 2.5
- Average bug resolution cost: $2,000
- Annual bug cost per developer: 2.5 × 12 × $2,000 = $60,000

With Optimization:
- 60% reduction in bugs
- Annual savings per developer: $60,000 × 60% = $36,000
```

**Technical Debt Reduction:**
```
Current Technical Debt Cost:
- 20% of development time spent on technical debt
- Cost per developer: $200,000 × 20% = $40,000 annually

With Better Practices:
- 50% reduction in technical debt accumulation
- Annual savings per developer: $20,000
```

### Time-to-Market Acceleration Value

**Feature Delivery Acceleration:**
```
Current State:
- Average feature development: 3 months
- Features per year: 12
- Revenue per month of early delivery: $50,000

With Optimization:
- 40% faster feature delivery (1.8 months vs. 3 months)
- Time savings per feature: 1.2 months
- Annual time-to-market value: 12 features × 1.2 months × $50,000 = $720,000
```
