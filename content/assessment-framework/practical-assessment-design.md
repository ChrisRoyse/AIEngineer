# Practical Assessment Design for Agentic Engineering

## Overview

This document outlines the practical assessment methodology for evaluating agentic engineering competencies through hands-on projects, portfolio development, and real-world implementation challenges. The design emphasizes authentic assessment that mirrors professional practice and provides tangible evidence of capability.

## Assessment Philosophy

### Principles
- **Authenticity**: Assessments reflect real-world professional challenges
