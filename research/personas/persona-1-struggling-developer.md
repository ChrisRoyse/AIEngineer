**Experience:** 3 years professional development  
**Location:** Austin, Texas  
**Education:** Computer Science degree from state university  
**Salary Range:** $75,000 - $85,000  

## Professional Context
Marcus works at a growing SaaS company where he's expected to deliver features quickly but often feels overwhelmed by the complexity of modern development workflows. He's competent with basic programming but struggles with advanced debugging, architecture decisions, and staying current with rapidly evolving technologies.

**Technology Stack:**

## Current AI Tool Usage & Pain Points

**Current Tools:**
- GitHub Copilot (basic subscription) - uses occasionally but doesn't trust suggestions
- ChatGPT free tier - asks basic syntax questions
- Stack Overflow - primary problem-solving resource

**Pain Points:**
- Spends 40-50% of time debugging and researching solutions
- Feels behind compared to senior developers
- Struggles to implement complex features without extensive help
- Code reviews often require multiple rounds of revisions
- Imposter syndrome when working with AI tools - doesn't understand how to validate AI suggestions
- Difficulty translating business requirements into technical solutions

**Quote:** *"I know AI is supposed to make coding easier, but I'm scared I'll break something if I use it wrong. I spend more time second-guessing the AI than just writing code myself."*

**Motivations:**
- Fear of being left behind as AI transforms software development
- Desire to contribute more meaningfully to team projects
- Want to work on interesting features rather than just bug fixes
- Need to increase earning potential for growing family
