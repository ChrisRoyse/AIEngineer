# TikTok Viral Strategy 2025
## Developer Education & Authentic Content Framework

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
TikTok's 2025 algorithm prioritizes video completion rates above all metrics, with educational content seeing unprecedented growth in the developer/tech space. The platform now values authenticity and relatability over production quality, while short-form videos under 10 seconds drive the highest engagement rates. Pattern interrupts, visual hooks, and authentic personality integration are critical for viral success.
