## Individual Developer ROI Calculator

### Input Variables

#### Personal Metrics
- **Current Annual Salary**: $X (default ranges: Junior $60K-80K, Mid $80K-120K, Senior $120K-180K)
- **Years of Experience**: X years
- **Current Productivity Level**: Tasks completed per sprint (baseline 100%)
- **Bug Rate**: Bugs per feature delivered (baseline metric)
- **Learning Time**: Hours spent learning new technologies weekly
- **Career Advancement Goal**: Target role and salary within timeframe

#### Market Benchmarks
- **AI Skill Premium**: 15-25% salary increase for AI-proficient developers
- **Productivity Improvement**: 26% task completion increase with proper AI training
- **Quality Improvement**: 60% bug reduction vs. 41% increase without training
- **Learning Acceleration**: 60% reduction in time to master new frameworks
- **Career Acceleration**: 6 months to mid-level vs. 2 years traditional path

### Calculation Framework

#### Immediate Productivity Gains (Year 1)
```
Base Productivity Value = (Annual Salary / 2080 hours) × Hours Saved Annually
Hours Saved = (Current Weekly Hours × 26% improvement × 52 weeks)
Immediate Productivity ROI = Hours Saved × Hourly Rate
```

**Example Calculation - Mid-Level Developer ($100K salary)**:
- Hourly Rate: $100,000 ÷ 2080 = $48.08/hour
- Hours Saved: 40 hours/week × 26% × 52 weeks = 540.8 hours
- Immediate Value: 540.8 × $48.08 = $26,008

#### Quality Improvement Value (Year 1)
```
Bug Cost Baseline = Average hours spent debugging × Hourly Rate × Bugs per month × 12
Quality Improvement = Baseline × 60% reduction
```

**Example Calculation**:
- Debugging Time: 8 hours/month average
- Bug Cost Baseline: 8 × $48.08 × 12 = $4,608
- Quality Improvement Value: $4,608 × 60% = $2,765

#### Career Advancement Acceleration (Years 1-3)
```
Salary Increase Acceleration = (Target Salary - Current Salary) × Time Saved Percentage
AI Skill Premium = New Salary × 20% average premium
```

**Example Calculation**:
- Traditional advancement: $100K → $130K in 3 years
- Accelerated timeline: Achieve in 18 months
- Time Value: $30K × 50% faster = $15K additional earning
- AI Premium: $130K × 20% = $26K additional annual value

#### Total Individual ROI Calculation

| Value Component | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total 3-Year |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Productivity Gains** | $26,008 | $27,308 | $28,674 | $82,000 |
| **Quality Improvements** | $2,765 | $2,903 | $3,048 | $8,716 |
| **Career Acceleration** | $15,000 | $26,000 | $26,000 | $67,000 |
| **Learning Efficiency** | $5,200 | $5,460 | $5,733 | $16,393 |
| **Total Annual Value** | $48,973 | $61,671 | $63,455 | $174,109 |

**Investment**: $5,000 coaching program
**3-Year ROI**: 3,382% ($174,109 ÷ $5,000)
**Payback Period**: 1.2 months

## Enterprise ROI Calculator

### Input Variables

#### Team Metrics
- **Number of Developers**: X (default ranges: Small 10-25, Medium 25-100, Large 100+)
- **Average Developer Salary**: $X (including benefits, typically 1.3x base salary)
- **Current Development Velocity**: Story points or features per sprint
- **Bug Rate**: Production bugs per release cycle
- **Technical Debt Hours**: Weekly hours spent on maintenance vs. new features
- **Team Turnover Rate**: Annual developer turnover percentage

#### Enterprise Costs
- **Hiring Cost per Developer**: $15,000-30,000 average
- **Training Cost per Developer**: $3,000-8,000 annually
- **Bug Cost per Incident**: $5,000-50,000 depending on severity
- **Technical Debt Maintenance**: 42% of developer time (industry average)
- **Delayed Feature Cost**: Revenue impact of slower time-to-market

### Calculation Framework

#### Development Efficiency Improvement
```
Base Development Cost = (Team Size × Avg Salary × 1.3) 
Efficiency Improvement = Base Cost × 30% delivery acceleration
Annual Savings = Efficiency Improvement × Revenue per Feature Velocity
```

**Example Calculation - 50 Developer Team**:
- Total Salary Cost: 50 × $100K × 1.3 = $6.5M
- Efficiency Improvement: 30% faster delivery
- Value Creation: $6.5M × 30% = $1.95M annual value

#### Quality Improvement ROI
```
Current Bug Cost = Average Bugs per Month × Cost per Bug × 12
Quality Improvement = Current Bug Cost × 60% reduction
```

**Example Calculation**:
- Monthly Production Bugs: 25
- Average Cost per Bug: $8,000 (including investigation, fixes, customer impact)
- Annual Bug Cost: 25 × $8,000 × 12 = $2.4M
- Quality Improvement Value: $2.4M × 60% = $1.44M

#### Technical Debt Reduction
```
Technical Debt Cost = Team Size × Avg Salary × 42% maintenance time
Debt Reduction = Technical Debt Cost × 25% improvement
```

**Example Calculation**:
- Annual Technical Debt Cost: 50 × $130K × 42% = $2.73M
- Debt Reduction Value: $2.73M × 25% = $682K

#### Talent Retention Value
```
Turnover Cost = Team Size × Turnover Rate × (Hiring Cost + Training Cost + Productivity Loss)
Retention Improvement = Turnover Cost × 50% reduction in turnover
```

**Example Calculation**:
- Current Turnover: 50 developers × 20% = 10 departures
- Cost per Departure: $25K hiring + $5K training + $40K productivity loss = $70K
- Annual Turnover Cost: 10 × $70K = $700K
- Retention Value: $700K × 50% = $350K

#### Enterprise ROI Summary (50-Developer Team)

| Value Component | Annual Value | 3-Year Value |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Development Efficiency** | $1,950,000 | $5,850,000 |
| **Quality Improvements** | $1,440,000 | $4,320,000 |
| **Technical Debt Reduction** | $682,000 | $2,046,000 |
| **Talent Retention** | $350,000 | $1,050,000 |
| **Innovation Acceleration** | $500,000 | $1,500,000 |
| **Total Annual Value** | $4,922,000 | $14,766,000 |
