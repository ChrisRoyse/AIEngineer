# Pricing Testing and Optimization Plan

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive testing plan establishes a data-driven approach to pricing optimization using A/B testing methodologies, price sensitivity analysis, and continuous market feedback. The framework enables iterative pricing improvements while minimizing risk and maximizing revenue growth across all market segments.

## Testing Philosophy and Framework

### Core Testing Principles
1. **Statistical Significance**: Minimum 95% confidence level for all tests
2. **Business Impact Focus**: Prioritize tests with highest revenue potential
3. **Customer Experience Protection**: Never compromise user experience for price testing
4. **Ethical Testing**: Transparent and fair pricing experiments
5. **Continuous Optimization**: Ongoing refinement based on market feedback

### Risk Management Approach
- **Revenue Protection**: Test pricing increases with smaller segments first
- **Customer Retention**: Monitor churn rates during price testing
- **Brand Protection**: Maintain consistent value messaging
- **Competitive Response**: Monitor competitor reactions to pricing changes

## Primary Pricing Tests

### Test 1: Anchoring Strategy Effectiveness

#### Hypothesis
Leading with enterprise pricing ($500,000) increases conversion rates and average order value across all individual tiers by creating favorable price anchoring.

#### Test Design
**Control Group (A)**: Standard pricing presentation (Foundation → Professional → Expert)
**Treatment Group (B)**: Enterprise-anchored presentation (Enterprise → Expert → Professional → Foundation)

#### Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Overall conversion rate improvement
- **Secondary**: Average order value increase
- **Tertiary**: Tier upgrade rate (Foundation → Professional, Professional → Expert)

#### Sample Size Calculation
- Expected effect: 15% conversion improvement
- Power: 80%, Alpha: 0.05
- Required sample: 1,566 visitors per variant
- Test duration: 4-6 weeks

#### Expected Outcome
15-25% improvement in conversion rates, 8-12% increase in average order value.

### Test 2: Charm Pricing Impact

#### Hypothesis
Prices ending in "97" ($197, $1,997, $7,997) outperform round numbers ($200, $2,000, $8,000) in terms of conversion rates and price perception.

#### Test Design
**Control Group (A)**: Charm pricing ($197, $1,997, $7,997)
**Treatment Group (B)**: Round pricing ($200, $2,000, $8,000)

#### Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Conversion rate by tier
- **Secondary**: Price perception survey scores
- **Tertiary**: Customer acquisition cost (CAC)

#### Statistical Framework
- Expected effect: 8-12% conversion improvement
- Minimum detectable effect: 5%
- Sample size: 2,200 visitors per variant
- Test duration: 6-8 weeks

### Test 3: Payment Structure Optimization

#### Hypothesis
Offering payment plans increases conversion rates for Professional and Expert tiers without significantly impacting customer lifetime value.

#### Test Design
**Control Group (A)**: Single payment only
**Treatment Group (B)**: Multiple payment options
- Full payment (5% discount)
- 3-month payment plan
- 6-month payment plan

#### Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Conversion rate improvement
- **Secondary**: Total revenue per customer
- **Tertiary**: Customer lifetime value and retention

#### Financial Impact Modeling
```
Professional Tier Analysis:
Single Payment: $1,997 × 100 conversions = $199,700
Payment Plans: $2,097 average × 125 conversions = $262,125
Net improvement: $62,425 (31% revenue increase)
```

### Test 4: Social Proof Effectiveness

#### Hypothesis
Different types of social proof (testimonials, statistics, logos, peer comparisons) have varying impacts on conversion across demographic segments.

#### Test Variants
**Control (A)**: Testimonial-heavy social proof
**Treatment B**: Statistics-focused proof ("95% report career advancement")
**Treatment C**: Logo wall (company/university affiliations)
**Treatment D**: Peer comparison ("Join 2,000+ successful developers")

#### Segmentation Analysis
- By experience level (junior, mid, senior)
- By company size (startup, mid-size, enterprise)
- By geographic region
- By referral source

#### Success Metrics
- Conversion rate by segment
- Time to purchase decision
- Upgrade rate within 12 months

### Test 5: Scarcity and Urgency Tactics

#### Hypothesis
Limited-time offers and enrollment caps increase conversion rates and reduce purchase decision time without negatively impacting customer satisfaction.

#### Test Design
**Control Group (A)**: No scarcity messaging
**Treatment Group B**: Limited cohort size ("Only 25 spots remaining")
**Treatment Group C**: Time-limited pricing ("Early bird pricing ends in 7 days")
**Treatment Group D**: Combined scarcity and urgency

#### Measurement Framework
- Immediate conversion rate
- Purchase decision timeline
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Long-term retention rates

#### Ethical Considerations
- Authentic scarcity only (real enrollment limits)
- Transparent communication
- Customer value focus over pressure tactics

## Price Sensitivity Analysis

### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

#### Survey Implementation
Deploy to 1,000+ potential customers across all target segments:

**Questions for Foundation Tier**:
1. "At what price would agentic engineering coaching be so expensive that you would not consider it?"
2. "At what price would you consider it to be priced so low that you'd question the quality?"
3. "At what price would you consider it to be getting expensive but still worth considering?"
4. "At what price would you consider it to be a bargain?"

#### Analysis Framework
- **Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC)**: Quality concern threshold
- **Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME)**: Consideration limit
- **Indifference Price Point (IPP)**: Optimal price point
- **Optimal Price Point (OPP)**: Revenue maximization price

### Gabor-Granger Price Testing

#### Methodology
Sequential price point testing with purchase intent questions:

**Foundation Tier Price Points**: $97, $147, $197, $247, $297, $397
**Professional Tier Price Points**: $1,497, $1,747, $1,997, $2,247, $2,497, $2,997

#### Purchase Intent Questions
"Would you purchase agentic engineering coaching at $[PRICE]?"
- Definitely would purchase
- Probably would purchase  
- Might or might not purchase
- Probably would not purchase
- Definitely would not purchase

#### Demand Curve Creation
Plot purchase intent vs. price to identify optimal revenue point.

- **Demographic Mix**: Various experience levels, company sizes, industries
- **Facilitation**: External moderator to minimize bias

### Quantitative Feedback Collection

#### Post-Purchase Surveys
- "How did the price influence your purchase decision?"
- "What price would you have considered too high?"
- "How does the value received compare to price paid?"
- "Would you recommend at this price point?"

#### Net Promoter Score (NPS) by Price Tier
Track NPS scores across all tiers to identify price-satisfaction relationships:
- Target: NPS > 70 across all tiers
- Alert threshold: NPS < 50 for any tier
- Investigation trigger: 10+ point NPS drop

## Advanced Testing Methodologies

2. **Loss Framing**: "Avoid losing $Y in career advancement"
3. **Neutral Framing**: "Investment of $Z for transformation program"

#### Payment Timing Psychology
- **Pre-payment Discounts**: Pay upfront for program starting in 30 days
